# Frequent Subgraph Mining in Oceanographic Multi-level Directed Graphs

This package contains R and Python scripts and data for generating and visualizing n-subgraphs, n-convergences, n-divergences and n-paths.

## Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

## Package description

### Scripts

#### R (subdirectory "R")

* prepare_gspan_input.R - generates the file "input.g" which contains the input data for the gSpan algorithm. The input is based on multi-level directed graphs (subdirectory data/multilevel_graphs) and the selected discretization of edges weights in the mentioned graphs.
* 

#### Python  R (subdirectory "R")

### Datasets (subdirectory "data")

#### multilevel_graphs

This subdirectory contains multi-level directed graphs, which are the result of the methodology described in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417413001541.

#### gspan

#### subgraphs

#### vertices
